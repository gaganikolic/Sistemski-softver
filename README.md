# System Software Project – Assembler, Linker, and Emulator Toolchain

This project was developed as part of the *System Software* course and consists of three interconnected components:

1. **Assembler** – translates assembly source code into object code
2. **Linker** – combines multiple object files into a single executable
3. **Emulator** – simulates the execution of the resulting binary on an abstract machine

Together, these tools form a complete **software development toolchain** for an abstract computer architecture.
